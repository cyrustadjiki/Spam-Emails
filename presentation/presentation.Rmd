# Introduction
- Spam messages are annoying but also invasive

- An open spam email can transmit personal and computer information to a spammer, including:
  - your IP address
  - your location
  - your device type
  - your operating system
  - your place of work
  - and more...
  
- Email providers use machine algorithms to screen messages and protect their users, which is what we will be attempting to do

- **Research Question:** What type of model predicts spam emails using word frequencies the best?

# Data

 - We got data on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/venky73/spam-mails-dataset)
 - Text of 500 spam emails and 2,500 non-spam emails
 - Stemming (retrieving the root of a word)
 - Removing common stop words (such as “the” and “to”)
